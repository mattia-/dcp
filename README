1) =========== COMPILATION ===============
-) create a directory in which to build the code. In the following steps, it will be supposed that such directory is
   called "build" and was created in the same directory as the one where this README file is
     $ mkdir build

-) change directory
     $ cd build

-) launch cmake with the path to the root directory of the source tree. If the directory "build" was created where
   this README file is:
     $ cmake ..
   
   various options can be passed to cmake: 
       C_COMPILER and CXX_COMPILER: the C and C++ compiler to be used
       CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: sets the compilation type, to allow for some optimization at compile time (see CMake documentation
                         for more details)
       LIB_INSTAL_DIR: directory for the installation of the library. Default value: the directory "lib" in the root directory
                       of the source tree
       HEADER_INSTAL_DIR: directory for the installation of the header files. Default value: the directory "include" 
                          in the root directory of the source tree

   all option can be set from command line using the flag "-D":
     $ cmake .. -DVARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_VALUE

-) compile
     $ make

   the makefile supports parallel compilation through the flag "-j". For example, to compile using 4 threads use the command:
     $ make -j 4

 
2) =========== INSTALLATION ===============
  From the build directory, launch
     $ make install


3) =========== TEST ===============
  To run a test, go to the "test" directory and follow the instructions of the file README in there
