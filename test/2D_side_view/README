This collection of files sets up the case for the control problem:
[
    insert control problem description
]

Steps to launch the code:
1) create a directory in which to build the code. In the following steps, it will be supposed that such directory was
called "build" and was created in the same directory as the one where this README file is
    $ mkdir build

2) change directory
    $ cd build

3) launch cmake
    $ cmake ..
   
   various options can be passed to cmake. For example, to allow compiler optimizations, run
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

4) compile
    $ make

5) run the first executable, which by default is called "compute_target_solution" and is located in the folder
   build/src/
   This executable may take four different command line arguments:
   -) mesh_file_name:       the name of the file containing the mesh for the problem. 
                            The default value is: ../src/complete_mesh/complete_mesh.xml
   -) u_output_file_name:   the name of the file to which the velocity component of the solution will be saved. It will
                            be a HDF5 file, and format string ".hdf5" will be automatically appended
                            The default value is: ../src/u_target
   -) p_output_file_name:   the name of the file to which the pressure component of the solution will be saved. It will
                            be a HDF5 file, and format string ".hdf5" will be automatically appended
                            The default value is: ../src/p_target.
   -) human_readable_print: boolean flag. If set to true, also prints velocity and pressure to human readable format
                            (in particular, pvd format - i.e. xml + vtk - will be used). The name of such files will
                            be the same as the name of the hdf5 file, with different extension.
                            The dafault value is false
   In all three cases, "../src" is prepended, so that from the directory build the program looks for the files in the
   directory src

   To launch the executable the command is:
    $ ./src/compute_target_solution --mesh_file_name <mesh_file> --u_output_file_name <u_file> --p_output_file_name <p_file>

   One or more of the command line options may not be given. In this case, default values will be used
