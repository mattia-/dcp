This collection of files sets up the case for a test control problem in which we wish to determine the
right inflow condition to reproduce the flow around a circle with a rectanglle in front of it once the
rectangle is removed

Steps to launch the code:
1) create a directory in which to build the code. In the following steps, it will be supposed that such directory is
called "build" and was created in the same directory as the one where this README file is
    $ mkdir build

2) change directory
    $ cd build

3) launch cmake
    $ cmake ..
   
   various options can be passed to cmake. For example, to allow compiler optimizations, run
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

4) compile
    $ make

5) run the first executable

   This executable may take four different command line arguments:
   -) mesh_file_name:       the name of the file containing the mesh for the problem. 
                            The default value is: ../src/complete_mesh/complete_mesh.xml
   -) output_file_name:     the name of the file to which the solution will be saved. It will
                            be a HDF5 file, and format string ".hdf5" will be automatically appended
                            The default value is: target_solution
   -) human_readable_print: boolean flag. If set to true, also prints velocity and pressure to human readable format
                            (in particular, pvd format - i.e. xml + vtk - will be used). The name of such files will
                            be the same as the name of the hdf5 file, with different extension.
                            The dafault value is false

   To launch the executable the command is:
    $ ./src/compute_target_solution --mesh_file_name <mesh_file> --output_file_name <file_name>

   One or more of the command line options may not be given. In this case, default values will be used

6) run the second executable

   The command line arguments for this executable are:
   -) complete_mesh_file_name:   the name of the file containing the mesh with the complete obstacle.
                                 The default value is: ../src/complete_mesh/complete_mesh.xml
   -) partial_mesh_file_name:    the name of the file containing the mesh with the partial obstacle.
                                 The default value is: ../src/complete_mesh/complete_mesh.xml
   -) target_solution_file_name: the name of the file from which the solution will be read. It will
                                 be a HDF5 file, and format string ".hdf5" will be automatically appended
                                 The default value is: u_target
   To launch the executable the command is:
    $ ./src/main --complete_mesh_file_name <complete_mesh_file> --partial_mesh_file_name <partial_mesh_file> \
                 --target_solution_file_name <file_name>
