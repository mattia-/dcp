The files in these folders are meant to show the usage of different key aspects of the library as well as be used
as a test to check if the installation went fine.

Every folder contains a README.rst file describing the problem implemented.

To compile and run all the tests::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make test
