# third step of the Guermond-Salgado splitting method

# domain type
cell = triangle

# function spaces
Q = FiniteElement ("Lagrange", cell, 1)

# coefficients
dt = Constant (cell)
chi = Constant (cell)
divu = Coefficient (Q)
    
# test and trial functions
phi = TrialFunction (Q)
psi = TestFunction (Q)
    
# pressure correction equation
# lhs
a = - inner (grad (phi), grad (psi)) * dx

# rhs
L = chi / dt * inner (divu, psi) * dx
