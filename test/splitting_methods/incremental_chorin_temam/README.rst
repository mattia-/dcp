This collection of files sets up the case for a test splitting method
problem. We will use the Navier-Stokes equations with Chorin-Temam 
splitting to study the 2D flow inside a cavity with a moving lid


Steps to launch the code:

1) compile::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

2) run the executable::

    ./src/main
