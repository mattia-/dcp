# third step of the Chorin-Temam splitting method

# domain type
cell = triangle

# function space
Q = FiniteElement ("Lagrange", cell, 1)

# coefficients
p_old = Coefficient (Q)
dp = Coefficient (Q)

# test and trial function
p = TrialFunction (Q)
q = TestFunction (Q)

# projection equation:
a = inner (p, q) * dx

# rhs
L = inner (p_old, q) * dx + inner (dp, q) * dx
