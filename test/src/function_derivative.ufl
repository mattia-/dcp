# UFL file to compute the second order derivative
# 
# This ufl files describes the problem:
#       u = \nabla f                  in \Omega
#       \nabla u \cdot n = 0          su \partial \Omega
#
#
# define mesh dimension
cell = interval

# define function space
V = FiniteElement ("Lagrange", cell, 2)

# define test and trial function
u = TrialFunction (V)
v = TestFunction (V)

# define coefficients
f = Coefficient (V);

# define linear form
L = inner (f.dx (0), v) * dx

# define bilinear form
a = inner (u, v) * dx
