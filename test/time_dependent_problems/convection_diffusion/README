This collection of files sets up the case for a test time dependent differential problem. 
We will use the time dependent convection-diffusion equation with 
mixed boundary conditions on the unit square:
$$ 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} -k \Delta u + b \nabla u = 0 \in \Omega
s.t.
u (x,t) = 0 \in \partial \Omega \times (0, T]
u (x, 0) = u_0 (x) \in \Omega
$$
with 
$$
k = 0.01
b = (1, 0)
u_0 = exp (-[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2]/0.2)
$$

Steps to launch the code:
1) create a directory in which to build the code. In the following steps, it will be supposed that such directory is
called "build" and was created in the same directory as the one where this README file is
    $ mkdir build

2) change directory
    $ cd build

3) launch cmake
    $ cmake ..
   
   various options can be passed to cmake. For example, to allow compiler optimizations, run
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

4) compile
    $ make

5) run the executable
    $ ./src/main
